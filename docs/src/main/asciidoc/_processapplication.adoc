== Using the ProcessApplication

By default, the camunda-spring-boot-starter is configured to use the SpringProcessEngineConfiguration auto deployment feature.
Since 1.2.0 you also have the possibility to do so via SpringBootProcessApplication. This disables the SpringProcessEngineConfiguration
auto-deploy feature and instead uses the required "META-INF/processes.xml"  as an indicator for resource scanning.
This also allows all processes.xml configuration features described here.

To use it, extend the ProcessApplication with your main application class:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication extends SpringBootProcessApplication{

...

}
----

=== @EnableProcessApplication

With 2.0.0, you can now use the @EnableProcessApplication annotation and do not need to extend a configuration manually:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableProcessApplication("myProcessApplicationName")
public class MyApplication {

...

}
----
