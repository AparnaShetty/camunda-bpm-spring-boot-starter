# camunda-spring-boot-starter


## How to contribute

*Hint for eclipse users:* clone the repo as `camunda-spring-boot-starter-root`

## Code Format

We use http://editorconfig.org in this project. If your IDE supports it, you do not have to add any additional configuration.
If you are not able to use this (unfortunately this applies to all eclipse based IDEs so far), make sure you use the [eclipse formatter](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/blob/master/settings/eclipse/formatter.xml).
